# Pac-Man

The goal is to move Pac-Man back and forth across the screen with slight animation (by using 4 images).

- Wrote the code within function checkPageBounds
- Globally declared pageWidth
- Added setTimeout

##Installation
1. Copy files to a local folder
2. Open Pac-Man.html in your preferred browser
3. Enjoy!
